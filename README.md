# Galaxy_Classification_Using_CNN_Tensorflow_Keras_Updated
A galaxy classification system using Optimal Convolution Neural Network has been designed and developed. Broadly there are five different types of galaxies. They are elliptical, spiral, disk, lenticular and irregular. We have proposed an optimal deep convolution neural network which learns the features of the different types of galaxies in the form of a set of filters and after the learning is over recognizes the type of the unknown galaxies. The CNN uses stratified data set of 300 images of different galaxies. With this, the optimal point with data size (150) as well as number of filters (130) of neither overshooting nor undershooting is found out to get the optimal network complexity â€“ which highly improves the performance evaluation. The performance evaluation of the CNN architecture used for galaxy classification in terms of its accuracy, precision, recall and f-score is quite satisfactory. Also the training and testing time is affordable.
